<h1>Callidate</h1>
<p>'callow' + 'candidate' = Callidate</p>
<p>A web-based political platform for the youth of America</p>

<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>The presidential election is coming up soon, and America is in the thick of a political storm of opinions and debates. The youth of America will be voting soon, and most of them are not well-informed enough to make a useful decision about who will be the next leader of the free world.</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>Callidate, a Flask-based web application with a slew of features that both inform the users and allow the users to share their opinions</p>

<h2>What we used</h2>
<h3>The site itself:</h3>
- Flask
- HTML
- CSS
<h3>The user forum:</h3>
- Firebase database
- JavaScript
<h3>The blog:</h3>
- SQLite
- Python
- Jinja
<h3>The search bar:</h3>
- Twitter (through tweepy API)
- New York Times (through NYT API)
