<h1>Callidate</h1>
<p>'callow' + 'candidate' = Callidate</p>
<p>A web-based political platform for the youth of America</p>

<br>

<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>The presidential election is coming up soon, and America is in the thick of a political storm of opinions and debates. The youth of America will be voting soon, and most of them are not well-informed enough to make a useful decision about who will be the next leader of the free world.</p>

<br>

<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>Callidate, a Flask-based web application with a slew of features that both inform the users and allow the users to share their opinions</p>

<br>

<h2>What we used</h2>
<p><strong>The site itself:</strong></p>
- Flask
- HTML
- CSS
<p><strong>The user forum:</strong></p>
- Firebase database
- JavaScript
<p><strong>The blog:</strong></p>
- SQLite
- Python
- Jinja
<p><strong>The search bar:</strong></p>
- Twitter (through tweepy API)
- New York Times (through NYT API)

<br>

<h2>Features</h2>
<strong>Landing Page</strong>
<p>This is the face of Callidate. The landing page is meant to give the quick facts about the political race. There is a portfolio of the presidential candidates, where you can click on their image and see basic information about their policies/beliefs and how they're doing in debates. Below this is a timeline of upcoming debates, who will be moderating them, and where they will air.</p>
<strong>User Forum</strong>
<p>This is a live chat where users can discuss their opinions on the debate, how they feel about controversial policies, and share their general thoughts about the presidential race.</p>
<strong>Blog</strong>
<p>Here is where users can write longer posts to share their thoughts. All users can look at all blog posts, but, in order to create a post, you must create an acocunt and sign in. Users with accounts can then either create posts or edit their previous posts.</p>
<strong>Search</strong>
<p>Just in case the landing page didn't provide enough information, we have a search bar. Here users can query information from the New York Times and Twitter, and see the results side-by-side to compare public and editorial content about the presidential race.</p>

<br>

<h2>In the Future</h2>
- Have landing page automatically update the candidates instead of having to hard-code them
- Show most-talked-about candidates
- Show information about political races other than the presidential race
- Allow for threaded conservations in the forum
- Allow for tagging/filtering posts in the blog
- Allow for more editorial content by creating official writer accounts for professional political commentators
- Add more sites to query information from in the search bar
